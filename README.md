# G.H.O.S.T. Paper Simulation Data and Code

This repository contains the simulation environment and experimental data for the paper:
**"G.H.O.S.T.: A Scalable Framework for Metadata-Resistant Messaging with Token-Based Incentives"**

## Contents
- `/simulations`: Python scripts used to model the G.H.O.S.T. protocol, including entropy analysis, intersection attacks, and economic viability.
- `/results`: CSV files containing the raw data generated by the simulations.

## Requirements
To run the simulations, you will need:
- Python 3.10+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Pandas

## Usage
Each script in the `simulations/` directory can be run independently. For example:
```bash
python simulations/experiment_entropy_attack.py
```
